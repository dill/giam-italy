This folder contains the code to reproduce the results in the analysis of
Italian RFP data by Marra, Miller and Zanin.

Required R packages and where you can get them:
mgcv           - http://people.bath.ac.uk/sw283/mgcv/
soap           - http://www.maths.bath.ac.uk/~sw283/simon/software.html
dillhandy      - https://github.com/dill/dillhandy


Files and their purposes are as follows:

Scripts that may be run directly:
model.R              - soap film smoother of RFP incidence
additivecomparison.R - incidence model with additive temporal effect
residmodel.R         - fit a GAM to the residuals (incidence), to check for structure
trends.R             - create the temporal incidence trend plots
indexmodel.R         - smoother for the ISEA data
indexresids.R        - fit a GAM to the residuals (ISEA), to check for structure
makediagplots.R      - create the 2x2 diagnostic plots for incidence data
                       (requires that model.R is run first to create RData file)

Utility scripts:
diagnostics.R        - function to create the 2x2 diagnosic plots
fixit.R              - take the raw data and put it into the correct format


Data:
database_complete.csv   - raw incidence data
database_index.csv      - ISEA data
