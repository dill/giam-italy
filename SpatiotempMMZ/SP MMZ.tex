Over recent years, many European countries have experienced a substantial increase in the fraction of immigrants in the population. The incidence of foreigners calculated on a national level does not provide information on the spatial and temporal distribution of the phenomenon, which may be crucial to demographers, economists, sociologists, and policy makers, to name a few, to study and formulate adequate policies supporting, e.g., the process of integration of resident foreigners in a host country. In this paper we suggest a tool for practitioners to provide spatiotemporal maps representing, in the space, the distribution of incidence of foreigners in the territory, and over time, changes of spatial trends. In doing this, we use Italian data at municipal level, for the period $2003-2008$. The temporal trend of the incidence occurs at different strengths and patterns depending on the spatial location, hence it is necessary to allow for such interaction in the model. We propose using a generalized additive model incorporating a scale-invariant smoother of the space and time dimensions. Specifically, we set up a tensor product smooth combining a cubic regression spline basis for time and a soap film spline basis for space. This is because the smoother should not depend on the coordinate system used, and account for the structure of the geographical domain under investigation. In addition, we construct a composite indicator representing economic and labor market factors to explain some of the observed spatial heterogeneity. The employed approach provides a consistent framework to produce spatiotemporal maps which can be effectively used, e.g., by policy makers who have to decide the allocation at local level of economic resources.

\section{Introduction \label{IN}}

Increased political interest as well as academic interest has led to a large amount of research into international migration, both theoretical and empirical, exploring its causes and consequences. Several theories of migration have been proposed, from both a macro- and microeconomic point of view, based on different schools of thought. Among these are the neoclassical economic theory (Borjas 1989; Massey et al. 1993), the assumptions regarding the new economics of migration (Stark and Bloom 1985; Massey et al. 1993), dual labor markets (Piore 1979; Massey et al. 1993) and world systems theory (Wallerstein 1974; Portes and Walton 1981; Morawska 1990; Hooghe et al. 2008). In addition to theoretical work, many empirical studies have taken place. Examples include studies investigating: the impact of foreigners on the labor market of the host country (e.g., Borjas 1994, 2003, 2005; Borjas, Freeman and Katz 1996; Card 2005; Fullin and Reyneri 2010), underemployment (Slack and Jensen 2007), possible connections between immigration and nations' poverty rates (Raphael and Smolensky 2009), transfer of identity from the first to second generation immigrants (Casey and Dustmann 2010), difference in education, earnings and employment between first and second generation immigrants (Algan et al. 2010), problems relating to the integration of different cultures and languages (e.g., Lazear 1999; Contucci and Ghirlanda 2007), and the tendency for immigrants to live in ethnic ``enclaves'' (Edin, Fredriksson and Aslund 2003). 
  
Manning (2010) has pointed that, over recent years, many European countries have experienced a substantial increase in the fraction of immigrants in the population. Given a specific area such municipality, province, region, or nation, a measure of density of foreign population is the percentage incidence of resident foreigners, given as the ratio of the number of resident foreigners to the total resident population multiplied by 100 (e.g., De Bartolo 2007; Lowell 2007; Coleman 2008; Miguet 2008). This gives a simple, well-known, demographic indicator for comparing different regions of a country in terms of number of foreigners per 100 resident inhabitants. It can be thought of as indicative of the spatial distribution of foreigners and thus identify areas of the country with a greater or lesser presence of resident foreigners in the population (e.g., OECD 2004). 

Here we consider the Italian case. According to the Italian National Statistical Office (ISTAT), the incidence of resident foreigners has grown substantially over the last years (from 2.7\% in 2002 to 6.5\% in 2008). This phenomenon has had an impact on the population, especially from a socio-demographic point of view (see Section \ref{DEM} for details). The incidence of foreigners calculated on a national level does not tell us anything specific on the spatial distribution of the phenomenon. Knowing how the distribution of foreigners changes over time and space can be of paramount importance to demographers, economists, sociologists, and policy makers, to name a few, to study and formulate adequate policies supporting, e.g., the process of integration of resident foreigners in a host country. 

To the best of our knowledge, no studies have attempted to model the spatiotemporal distribution of the incidence of foreigners in a country. Our study uses annual Italian data obtained from the Italian National Statistical Office (ISTAT) for the period $2003-2008$. Since 2003, ISTAT has provided a new public database with annual frequency of the number of resident foreigners at a municipal level. This data represents the current maximum spatial and temporal detail available. Our emphasis is to suggest a tool for practitioners to provide spatiotemporal maps representing, in the space, the distribution of incidence of foreigners in the territory, and over time, changes of spatial trends. The results of such an investigation complement previous findings.

To assess what draws foreigners to one particular area over another, it is useful to have some quantitative measure of the ``attractiveness'' of each area to foreigners. Here, we focus on economic and labor market factors, construct a composite indicator that we have named `Indicator of Spatial Economic Attractiveness (ISEA)' and produce spatiotemporal maps of this. Three important variables constitute the composite indicator: (i) added value per capita at constant price (base year 2000), (ii) unemployment rate and (iii) employment rate. Since these are typically readily available, this composite indicator can be easily constructed for many countries. The results can be analyzed in the light of the spatiotemporal maps of the incidence of resident foreigners.

A number of methodologies have been proposed for space–-time modeling (see, e.g., Augustin et al. (2009) and references therein). We opt for the spline approach to perform smoothing over some bounded domain $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$, over time (e.g., Hastie and Tibshirani 1990; Ruppert, Wand, and Carroll 2003; Wood 2006). Because currently no economic data are available at municipal level, the response (incidence of foreigners) is only modeled as a smooth function of time and spatial coordinates. The model is then used to create smooth maps of the geographical area of interest over time. Two points are noteworthy here. First, when a geographical region has complex boundaries, as in many applied contexts, features from one part of the domain can unduly influence other parts giving rise to a phenomenon known as \textit{leakage} (e.g., Ramsay 2002). Leakage typically occurs when a smoother inappropriately links two parts of a domain causing the fitted surface to be mis-estimated, leading to incorrect inference (e.g., biased incidence estimates), which is clearly not desirable. This issue can be overcome if the smoother used can account for the structure of the domain that is under investigation; several solutions have been proposed (e.g., Ramsay 2002; Wood, Bravington and Hedley 2008, and references therein). Second, because it is unlikely that the incidence of foreigners occurs at similar strengths and patterns over the territory, the employed approach should account for a space--time interaction. These two goals can be jointly achieved by using a scale-invariant three-dimensional tensor product smoother combining a cubic regression spline basis function for time trend and a soap film spline basis for the spatial dimensions (Wood 2006; Wood, Bravington and Hedley 2008).

\section{Data \label{DAT}}

\subsection{The structure and nature of the data on resident foreign population \label{SDC}}

The entry of foreigners from some countries of the European Union (EU) into Italy is regulated by the Schengen agreements. These allow for the elimination of border controls, hence creating a common area of free movement among the state members (Broeders 2007). Foreigners from a non-EU country must possess a visa or the necessary documents (for further details see the official website of the Ministry of the Interior http://www.interno.it). 
 
In studing a phenomenon linked to the international migration, it is need to distinguish between those individuals considered to be the resident foreign and those considered to be immigrants. The foreign population includes all people (born in Italy or abroad) who declare their citizenship to not be Italian. The immigrant population consists of all those born abroad who have declared to be foreigners or Italian by naturalisation (the later case refers to the acquisition of Italian citizenship). The foreigners born in Italy such as children born from foreign parents are excluded from immigrant population. The population census of 2001 showed that foreigners and immigrants constitute roughly the same group: about $81\%$ of immigrants have been identified by foreign citizenship, and $88\%$ of foreigners are immigrants (since they were born abroad).

In many countries, official statistics report the number of resident foreigners, but not the number of immigrants (Coleman 2008). Currently, the dynamics of immigration to Italy still allow the acceptance of a definition which does not distinguish between these two groups. This simplification is reasonable during the first phase of the immigration process in a country, and when the majority of immigrants keep their own citizenship for a long period. Indeed, this is the case in Italy. The population census gives the best distinction between immigrants and foreigners. In this case the data can be analysed by birthplace, citizenship at birth, and citizenship at the census time. 
 
Italian official statistics on the resident foreign population are mainly based on administrative sources linked to specific laws. Recently ISTAT has integrated the official statistics with a new public database (http://demo.istat.it). The database gives the number of resident foreigners calculated at the end of December each year in each municipality (of which there are around 8100). Compared to provincial or regional data, municipal-level data offers far more detail on the spatial distribution of the foreigners in the total population.
 
Populations are dynamic over time as well as space. In this regard, the change in number of foreign people at municipal level, at the end of a year, is determined by
$$
\text{RFP}^{31^\text{th}} = \text{RFP}^{1^\text{st}} + (I_1 + I_2 + I_3+ I_4) - (D_1 + D_2 + D_3 + D_4 + AC).
$$ 
$\text{RFP}^{31^\text{th}}$ indicates the total number of resident foreigners at the end of December, and $\text{RFP}^{1^\text{st}}$ the number of resident foreigners on the $1^\text{st}$ of January. $I_{1}$ denotes the number of people whose parents are foreigners (at least one of them being resident in the municipality), $I_{2}$ the number of foreign citizens who asked to transfer their residence from another Italian municipality to the current one, $I_{3}$ those who asked to transfer their residence from abroad, and $I_{4}$ refers to recording operations due to other reasons (e.g. foreigners mistakenly deleted from the registry of the municipality, because they were temporarily missing). $D_{1}$ represents the number of resident foreigners who died during the year, $D_{2}$ those who moved to a different municipality, $D_{3}$ those who moved abroad, $D_{4}$ refers to cancellations for other reasons (e.g., foreigners deleted from the registry of the municipality, because they were not present), and \textit{AC} denotes those resident foreigners who obtained Italian citizenship during the year. 

Acquisition of Italian citizenship by foreigners is regulated by law 91 of the $5^\text{th}$ of February 1992 and its subsequent amendments and additions. Foreigners can acquire the Italian citizenship by marriage to an Italian or by `naturalisation'. The latter case refers to the situation in which the foreigner has lived in the country from a certain period of time. Such a period varies dependent on the status of the person in question and the specific laws of each country. For example, in Italy, the period is at least 10 years for non-EU citizens, at least 4 years for EU citizens and at least 5 years for political refugees or stateless persons and adult individuals who been adopted by Italian citizens. An exhaustive list of ways to obtain Italian citizenship is available on the Ministry of the Interior's website. Once foreigners have acquired Italian citizenship, they are included in the Italian population's statistics. Hence, these individuals will come out from the numerator of the incidence of resident foreigners. However, our aim is to investigate and measure the incidence on the population of  residents who have not the Italian citizenship.

We do not tackle the issue of illegal foreigners presents in the country. This phenomenon and its respective quantification is an open topic of discussion in the studies of international migrations (e.g., Carter 1999; Hillman and Weiss 1999; De Bartolo 2007; Bchir 2008; Cangiano 2008; Strozza 2004). Several approaches have been proposed in literature to quantify this, but all are subject to criticism (especially with regard to the magnitude of errors in the estimates). Here we only consider official data on the resident foreign population. 

\subsection{The foreign population's contribution to Italy's demography \label{DEM}}

Bijak et al. (2007) shows that in the absence of migration, many of the 27 European Union countries could see a decline in their non-immigrant populations up to 2052. In particular, with no migration they estimate that the population of Italy could decrease from 57 million in 2002 to about 43 million in 2052. The main causes of this decline may be linked to a low fertility rate and hence an aging population. 

Looking at a traditional indicator that describes the weight of the elderly population, the ratio of old (over 64) to young (up to 14) in the total population was 143.4\% at the end of 2008 (156.2\% if we only consider individuals with Italian citizenship). The elderly population is about $43\%$ larger than the young population. Considering only the resident foreign population the ratio is 11.2\%. In the same year, the average age of foreigners resident in Italy was equal to 31, while that of Italian citizens was 43. From this information we evidence that there is a substantial difference in the age structure of the population present in Italy, if we stratify by citizenship.

As for the low fertility rate, the latest data from ISTAT puts the average number of children per Italian women of childbearing age (from 15 to 49 years) at 1.33, lower than the average of 2.05 children for foreign women living in Italy. Combining the fertility rate for both Italian and foreign women, we obtain an average of 1.41. Coleman (2008) states that ``typically, in low-mortality populations a total fertility of about 2.04 is regarded as the `replacement level', that is, a level sufficient to replace the population in the long-run, ignoring migration''. Given the impact of foreigners on the population structure, the measure of total fertility (and hence the level of replacement) must take into account the contribution of immigrants (Coleman 2008). The increasing presence of foreigners over recent years has contributed not only to population growth, but also to a reduction in average age and an increase in the total fertility rate.

The profile of the nationalities of resident foreigners in Italy is changing. Made 100 resident foreigners, in 2003, the top three countries represented were Albania (13.6\%), Morocco (12.7\%) and Romania (8.9\%). In 2008, Romania was top (20.5\%), followed by Albania (11.3\%) and Morocco (10.4\%). The significant increase of the Romanian population in Italy coincides with the country's entry to the European Union ($1^\text{st}$ January 2007). Currently, Romanian is the most abundant foreign nationality in 14 of the 20 Italian regions. Italy hosts the largest Romanian community outside Romania and almost half of the entire Romanian migrant stock. The choice of Italy as primary destination for Romanians can be explained by many factors including the presence of small Italian companies, the economic links with Romania, and the accessibility of the Italian language for Romanians (Ban 2009). 

According to a descriptive analysis of data from ISTAT, in 2008 the resident foreign population in Italy was made up of 53.6\% individuals from Europe, 22.4\% from Africa, 15.8\% from Asia, 8.1\% from America, and 0.1\% from Oceania.

\section{Methodology \label{METH}}

\subsection{Model specification \label{MS}}

The temporal trend of the incidence of resident foreigners is expected to occur at different strengths and patterns depending on the spatial location. For example, the incidence is expected to be more pronounced and rapid in North than in South Italy, because of the substantial differences at the demographic, social and economic levels. It is therefore necessary to allow for such interaction in the model. This can be achieved using a three-dimensional smooth function of space and time. 

The model we employ belongs to the class of generalized additive models (GAMs, Hastie and Tibshirani 1990). Such models allow for complex, non-linear relationships between covariates and the response, which are crucial to uncover interesting features in the data. The incidence of resident foreigners exhibits a positively skewed distribution; for this reason a gamma distribution provides a realistic description of the response variable. The proposed model is as follows
\beq
\text{log}\left\{\E(\texttt{irf}_{it})\right\} = f(\texttt{year}_t,\texttt{n}_i,\texttt{e}_i), \quad \texttt{irf}_{it} \sim \text{Gamma},          
\label{PropM}
\eeq
at location $i=1,\ldots,8094$ and year $t=1,\ldots,6$. The log link function ensures positive fitted values. $\texttt{irf}_{it}$, $\texttt{n}_i$, and $\texttt{e}_i$ represent the variables percentage incidence of resident foreigners, Northing, and Easting, respectively. The function $f$ is a multidimensional smooth of \texttt{year}, \texttt{n}, and \texttt{e} which models the joint effect of these variables on \texttt{irf}. Northing and Easting are simply offsets in kilometres from a set point, thus ensuring that the spatial part of the smooth is isotropic (as opposed to using latitude and longitude). We want both the space and time dimension to have an optimal degree of smoothness in terms of the bias-variance trade-off; the chosen smoother has to be invariant to the relative scaling of space (km) and time (years). In addition, the smoother has to allow for combinations of different basis functions most suitable for the space and time dimensions. This can be achieved by using a multidimensional tensor product smooth combining a cubic regression spline basis for \texttt{year} and a soap film spline basis for the two spatial dimensions \texttt{n} and \texttt{e}. This is because the smoother should not depend on the coordinate system used and account for the structure of the geographical domain under investigation (details are given in the next two sections). The smooth component in (\ref{PropM}) is subject to some identifiability constraint; see Wood (2006) for more details.

The next two sections cover the technical details of the construction of the smoothers. We first show how, in general a three-dimensional tensor product smoother can be constructed using a two-dimensional spatial smoother and a one-dimensional temporal smoother. We then go into the details of how the two-dimensional smoother is constructed in our case, to wit, the soap film smoother.

\subsection{A three-dimensional tensor product smoother for time and space \label{3D}}

The construction of a three-dimensional scale invariant tensor product smoother of time and space is based on a marginal one-dimensional spline basis for time and a two-dimensional marginal smooth for space, with associated quadratic penalties measuring their roughness. We omit the subscripts $i$ and $t$ for simplicity. Let us assume that we have two low-rank regression spline bases of any type to represent the smooth functions $f_\text{year}$ and $f_\text{space}$, we can write (e.g., Ruppert, Wand and Carroll 2003; Wood 2006)
$$
f_\text{year}(\texttt{year})=\sum_{l=1}^L \xi_l b_l(\texttt{year})=\textbf{X}_\text{year}\bm\xi \ \ \text{and} \ \ f_\text{space}(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})=\sum_{r=1}^R \varphi_r d_r(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})=\textbf{X}_\text{space}\bm\varphi,
$$
where the $b_l(\texttt{year})$ and $d_r(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ are known cubic regression spline and soap film basis functions, with corresponding parameters $\xi_l$ and $\varphi_r$ and spline dimensions $L$ and $R$. $\textbf{X}_\text{year}$ and $\textbf{X}_\text{space}$ are marginal model matrices evaluating the basis functions with parameter vectors $\bm\xi$ and $\bm\varphi$. The expansion for $f_\text{space}$ and its roughness penalty do not correspond exactly to the expressions used to set up the model since, in this section, we are concerned with illustrating the construction of a three-dimensional scale invariant tensor product smoother. It is therefore convenient to keep the description of the two-dimensional marginal smooth for space and its quadratic penalty as simple as possible, leaving a rigorous description will be given in the next section. 

In order to set up a three-dimensional tensor product smoother for time and space we need $f_\text{year}(\texttt{year})$ to vary smoothly within the space dimensions. This can be achieved by allowing the parameters $\xi_l$ to vary smoothly with \texttt{n} and \texttt{e}. Using the spline set-up for $f_\text{space}(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ we may write (e.g., Wood 2006, p. 163)
$$
\xi_l(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})=\sum_{r=1}^R \varphi_{lr} d_r(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})
$$    
which results in
$$
f(\texttt{year},\texttt{n},\texttt{e})=\sum_{l=1}^L \sum_{r=1}^R \varphi_{lr} d_r(\texttt{n},\texttt{e}) b_l(\texttt{year}). 
$$
For any particular set of observations of \texttt{year}, \texttt{n}, and \texttt{e}, there exists a simple relationship between the matrix $\textbf{X}$ evaluating the tensor product smooth at these observations, and the model matrices $\textbf{X}_\text{year}$ and $\textbf{X}_\text{space}$ evaluating the marginal smooths at the same observations. Ordering appropriately the parameters $\varphi_{lr}$ into a vector $\bm\theta$, the $i^{th}$ row of $\textbf{X}$ is given by $\textbf{X}_{i}=\textbf{X}_\text{year,i}\otimes\textbf{X}_\text{space,i}$, where $\otimes$ is the Kronecker product. 

In the GAM context, it is necessary to quantify the roughness of the smooth functions in the model so that over-fitting can be accounted for and hence avoided during the parameter estimation process (e.g., Marra and Radice 2010). As for the penalty associated with this tensor product basis, it is possible to start from roughness measures associated with the marginal smooths $f_\text{year}(\texttt{year})$ and $f_\text{space}(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$. Suppose that functionals $Js$ measuring the roughness of the smooth terms are available, and that these can be written as quadratic forms in the marginal parameters, we have that
$$
J_\text{year}(f_\text{year})=\bm\xi\ts\textbf{S}_\text{year}\bm\xi \ \ \text{and} \ \ J_\text{space}(f_\text{space})=\bm\varphi\ts\textbf{S}_\text{space}\bm\varphi,
$$
where the $\textbf{S}$ matrices contain known coefficients whose values depend on the chosen bases for time and space. For instance, the second-order cubic spline penalty for $f_\text{year}(\texttt{year})$ evaluates $J_\text{year}(f_\text{year})=\int\left( \partial^2 f_\text{year}/\partial \texttt{year}^2 \right)^2 d\texttt{year}$, but it may be more complex (Wood 2006, 2008). Following, e.g., Augustin (2009), an overall penalty for the tensor product smooth can be obtained by applying the penalties of $f_\text{space}(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ to the varying coefficients of the marginal smooth $f_\text{year}(\texttt{year})$, $\xi_l(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$,
$$
\sum_{l=1}^L J_\text{space}\left\{  \xi_l(\texttt{n},\texttt{e}) \right\},
$$ 
and the penalties of $f_\text{year}(\texttt{year})$ to the varying coefficients of the marginal smooth $f_\text{space}(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$, $\varphi_r(\texttt{year})$,  
$$
\sum_{r=1}^R J_\text{year}\left\{  \varphi_r(\texttt{year}) \right\}.
$$ 
It follows that the roughness penalty of $f(\texttt{year},\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ can be measured as 
$$
\lambda_\text{space} \sum_{l=1}^L J_\text{space}\left\{  \xi_l(\texttt{n},\texttt{e}) \right\} + \lambda_\text{year} \sum_{r=1}^R J_\text{year}\left\{  \varphi_r(\texttt{year}) \right\},
$$
which can also be written as
$$
\lambda_\text{space} \bm\theta\ts \textbf{I}_L \otimes \textbf{S}_\text{space} \bm\theta + \lambda_\text{year} \bm\theta\ts \textbf{S}_\text{year} \otimes \textbf{I}_R  \bm\theta,
$$
where, once again, the vector $\bm\theta$ contains the tensor product smooth parameters. The $\lambda$ are smoothing parameters controlling the trade-off between model fit and model smoothness. The next section shows how $f_\text{space}$ and $\textbf{S}_\text{space}$ can be constructed.   

This expression gives the tensor product penalty in the most general terms. However, in order to have an expression which can be later related to the soap film smoother, we re-express the penalty as:
$$
\bm\theta\ts \textbf{I}_L \otimes \textbf{S}^*_\text{space} \bm\theta + \bm\theta\ts \textbf{S}^*_\text{year} \otimes \textbf{I}_R  \bm\theta,
$$
where $\textbf{S}^*_\text{space}=\lambda_\text{space} \textbf{S}_\text{space}$ and $\textbf{S}^*_\text{year}=\lambda_\text{year} \textbf{S}_\text{year}$.


\subsubsection{Soap film \label{SF}}

As alluded to above, the smoother used for the spatial part of the model must take into account of the fact that the borders of Italy represent both physical and administrative geographic features. Clearly a rather na\"ive model would smooth over the bounding box encompassing all of the region we wish to draw inference on, this is not useful; first, because there are no resident foreigners in the sea (at best there are merely potential resident foreigners) and second, because smoothing over this whole area would cause leakage, as mentioned in the introduction.

Leakage occurs when a smoother inappropriately links two parts of a domain, this can happen when a two peninsulae jut out into the sea with different population densities on either side. Say one has a very high density, where as the other is significantly lower. Most smoothers will not respect that the two areas are different and should be treated so. Rather, the model will ``smooth across'' this gap, causing the high functional values to ``leak'' into the low valued peninsula and vice versa. There are, of course, situations in which leakage is appropriate. For example, in a study of the propagation of a chemical through a river system, there are several mechanisms to transport the chemical (e.g., surface water flow, animals) other than the river itself. Therefore there must be a motivation for why we wish to use a model that specifically prevents leakage. This is the case here, as there is no particular reason we should believe that the foreign population should be continuous across physical boundaries such as the Mediterranean Sea.

The soap film smoother (Wood, Bravington and Hedley 2008) uses a rather simple physical model to prevent leakage from occurring. First, consider the domain boundary to be made of wire, then dip this wire into a bucket of soapy water, you will then have a soap film in the same shape as the boundary. Now consider the wire to lie in the $\texttt{n}$-$\texttt{e}$ plane and the height of the soap film at a given point to be the functional value of the model. This film is then distorted smoothly by moving it vertically toward each datum locally, while minimising the surface tension in the film as a whole. The domain ($\Omega$) is bounded by some polygon ($B$) which, in this case is the coastlines. The boundary conditions on $B$ are estimated using a cyclic spline (Wood 2006, p. 151).

In order to perform soap film smoothing, we must first construct two sets of basis functions to form a smoother that conforms to the necessary boundary conditions. The first basis is used for the smoothing within the region of interest ($\Omega$); the second is for finding the values on the boundary (i.e., smoothing on $B$ itself). These bases are then summed to form
$$
f_\text{space}(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})=\sum_{j=1}^J \alpha_j a_j(\texttt{n},\texttt{e}) + \sum_{k=1}^K \gamma_k g_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e}),
$$
where the $\gamma_k$ and $\alpha_j$ are the parameters to be estimated. One can think of the $a_j(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ as an offset dictated by the estimated boundary conditions on $B$ (although it is important to note, they are not planes) and the sum of the $g_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ as the smooth to the data inside $\Omega$. For convenience later, we label the second sum as $f_\text{int}$. We now show how these bases are constructed.

For the internal part of the smooth we first find a set of functions $\rho_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$, which are each solutions to the Laplace's equation in two dimensions
$$
\frac{\partial^2\rho}{\partial \texttt{n}^2} + \frac{\partial^2\rho}{\partial \texttt{e}^2} = 0
$$
except at one of the knots ($\texttt{n}^*_k,\texttt{e}^*_k$). Then, we solve Poisson's equation in 2-dimensions
$$
\frac{\partial^2 g_k}{\partial \texttt{n}^2} + \frac{\partial^2 g_k}{\partial \texttt{e}^2} = \rho_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})
\label{soap-poisson}
$$
for $k$ indexing the $K$ knots. When the boundary condition $\rho_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})=0$ is applied, the set of basis functions for the soap film smoother, $g_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ is found.  The PDEs are solved numerically using successive overrelaxation (see the appendix of Wood, Bravington and Hedley 2008 for further details).

To find the boundary basis we first take a `boundary function', $f_\text{bnd}(r)$, using cyclic splines. The function evaluates the height of the function at each point around the boundary. $f_\text{bnd}(r)$ will have the expansion
\beq
f_\text{bnd}(r)=\sum_{j=1}^J \alpha_j \delta_j(r),
\label{soap-cyclic}
\eeq
where $r$ is the distance along the boundary, the $\alpha_j$ are parameters and $\delta_j$ are known cubic spline basis functions. To ensure that the spline is cyclic the usual constraint is enforced: that the value of the function at the first knot is the same as that at the last knot up to their second derivatives. Note that we don't find the $\alpha_j$ at this stage, for now we are only interested in the expansion. The basis functions $a_j(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ themselves can be found by solving (\ref{soap-poisson}) for $\rho_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})\equiv 0$ with the boundary condition resulting from setting $\alpha_j=1$ (and all other $\alpha_i$ to zero) in (\ref{soap-cyclic}), using the same methods as for the $g_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$, above. The $a_j(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ can be thought of as the set of functions with a peak at each of the $J$ points around the boundary in turn which are smooth across the whole of $\Omega$.

We have now found the set of basis functions for the inside of the domain and also the boundary-induced-smooth which acts as a base for the soap film smoother. Although this seems like a rather esoteric setup, all the procedure above is effectively doing is setting up a basis in order that we can use standard penalized regression techniques. Just as we might chose one spline basis over another for some property it possesses, the soap film basis has the property that it obeys the (estimated) boundary conditions of the region we are smoothing over.

As with the basis, the penalty is split into two parts: one for the cyclic smooth around the boundary and one for the internal smooth. Writing $\bm\beta$ as the vector of all smooth coefficients for the soap film, $\bm\gamma$ for the boundary smooth parameters and $\bm\alpha$ for the interior, we have
$$
\bm\beta^\text{T}\textbf{S}^*_\text{space}\bm{\beta} = \lambda_\text{bnd} \bm\gamma^\text{T}\textbf{S}_\text{bnd}\bm{\gamma} + \lambda_\text{int} \bm{\alpha}^\text{T}\textbf{S}_\text{int}\bm{\alpha},
$$
where 
$$
\textbf{S}^*_\text{space} = \lambda_\text{bnd} \textbf{S}_\text{bnd} + \lambda_\text{int} \textbf{S}_\text{int}.
$$
$\textbf{S}^*_\text{space}$ is the total penalty for the spatial part of the smooth, $\textbf{S}_\text{int}$ is the interior penalty and $\textbf{S}_\text{bnd}$ is the cyclic spline boundary penalty. Both are matrices of known coefficients depending on the chosen basis functions. The $\lambda$ are the smoothing parameters for the boundary and interior smooths respectively. As in the previous section, an asterisk indicates that the penalty matrices have been multiplied by the appropriate smoothing parameters, this is done for mathematical convenience. We now look at the two parts of the penalty individually. 

The isotropic interior penalty term is calculated as
$$
\textbf{S}_\text{int} = \int_\Omega \Big(\frac{\partial^2 f_\text{int}}{\partial \texttt{n}^2}+\frac{\partial^2 f_\text{int}}{\partial \texttt{e}^2} 
\Big)^2\text{d}\texttt{n}\text{d}\texttt{e},
$$
Note that the integration occurs only over $\Omega$, rather than over the whole of $\mathbb{R}^n$ as would usually be the case. Also, there is no mixed derivative term, and the whole integrand is squared rather than each term individually (in contrast with, say, a thin plate spline, see Wood (2003)). This allows the $\texttt{n}$ and $\texttt{e}$ term's derivatives to be traded off against each other so the nullspace of the penalty is infinite dimensional. This allows those functions in the nullspace to be sufficiently wiggly to meet any boundary conditions. The penalty for the cyclic spline running about the boundary, used to calculate the $\alpha_j$ is calculated as
$$
\textbf{S}_\text{bnd} = \int_B \Big(\frac{\partial^2 f_\text{bnd}}{\partial r^2}\Big)^2 \text{d}r.
$$
See Wood (2006) for further details.

The solution of the PDEs above, yielding the basis and penalty, is the most computationally expensive part of the procedure. Knots to use for $\texttt{n}_k^*$ and $\texttt{e}_k^*$ must be specified, here we use a grid (further detail on our exact setup is given below). In summary, we now have both the basis functions $a_j(\texttt{n}_i,\texttt{e}_i)$ and $g_j(\texttt{n}_i,\texttt{e}_i)$, and the penalties $\textbf{S}_\text{bnd}$ and $\textbf{S}_\text{int}$, forming $\textbf{S}^*_\text{space}$, for the soap film smoother. 

\subsection{Parameter estimation \label{PE}}

In model (\ref{PropM}), replacing $f$ with its tensor product expression yields a generalized linear model (GLM; McCullagh and Nelder 1989) whose design matrix contains the spline bases representing the smooth component in the model. In principle such a model can simply be estimated by maximum likelihood (ML). However, in a smoothing spline context, unpenalized parameter estimation is likely to result in smooth component estimates that are too `wiggly', hence undermining the utility of such a model. This can be overcome by penalized ML, where the use of penalties allows for the suppression of that part of smooth term complexity which has no support from the data (e.g., Marra and Radice 2010). Specifically, the model can be fitted by minimization of
\beq
D(\bm\theta) + \bm\theta\ts\textbf{S}^*\bm\theta \ \  \text{w.r.t.} \ \  \bm\theta,
\label{Dev}
\eeq
where $\bm\theta$ contains all tensor product smooth parameters associated with the one-dimensional spline basis for time and two-dimensional smooth for space, and $\textbf{S}^*=\sum_i \lambda_i \textbf{S}_i$, where the $\textbf{S}_i$ are matrices of known coefficients properly defined according to the results of the previous sections with associated smoothing parameters $\lambda_i$. The model deviance, $D$, is defined as $2\phi(l_{\text{sat}}-l)$, where $\phi$ is a dispersion parameter, $l$ is the log-likelihood of the model and $l_{\text{sat}}$ the maximum value for the log-likelihood of the model with one parameter per datum. 

Given values for the $\lambda_i$, minimization of (\ref{Dev}) is straightforward. However, smoothing parameter estimation has to be addressed. This can be achieved by minimization of a prediction error estimate, such as the generalized cross-validation (GCV) (Craven and Wahba 1979), or by approximate restricted ML (REML) estimation (Wood 2010). Smoothing parameter selection via the GCV consists of minimizing 
\beq
V(\bm\lambda)=\frac{nD(\hat{\bm\theta})}{\left\{n-\text{tr}(\textbf{F})\right\}^2},
\label{GCV1}
\eeq
where $\textbf{F}$ is the usual hat matrix, and $\text{tr}(\textbf{F})$ represents the effective degrees of freedom (edf) or number of estimated parameters of the penalized model. Wood (2006) described a computational procedure to estimate smoothing parameters on the basis of criterion (\ref{GCV1}). As an alternative, approximate REML can be employed. Within this framework, the penalized likelihood estimates, $\hat{\bm\theta}$, can be seen as the posterior modes of the distribution of $\bm\theta|{\bf y}$ if $\bm\theta \sim N(\textbf{0},\textbf{S}^{*-1})$, where $\textbf{S}^{*-1}$ is an appropriate generalized inverse. Viewing the spline parameters as random effects allows for the possibility to estimate the $\lambda_i$ via REML (Wahba 1985). The recent work by Reiss and Ogden (2009) shows that at finite sample sizes GCV is prone to undersmoothing and is more likely to develop multiple minima than REML. Therefore, we employ REML given its practical advantages for smoothing parameter selection. We use the \texttt{gam()} function of the \texttt{R} package \texttt{mgcv} since approximate REML optimization for GAMs is reliably and efficiently implemented (Wood 2010). During the model fitting process, a common shape parameter is assumed for all gamma distributions across all years (preliminary descriptive analysis suggested that this is the case).

Given the dimension of the dataset used here, we experienced some numerical issues which could not be rectified. This was eventually dealt with by trying to find a compromise between tensor product basis dimension and dataset reduction. The final model was fitted on data obtained by averaging over a $150\times150$ grid for all years. The basis sizes (for the cubic and cyclic regression splines) and interior knots (for the soap film) are given in Table \ref{soap-basis-table}.

\label{soap-basis-table}
\end{table}

The proposed model takes into account temporal and spatial features via the space–-time smoother. However, the presence of residual temporal or spatial structure can not in general be ruled out (e.g., Augustin et al. 2009). In order to explore the sensitivity of our estimates to model misspecification, we employed a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM; Lin and Zhang 1999), which can handle smooth function estimation and a number of correlation structures simultaneously. Since a GAMM can be seen a generalized linear mixed model, estimation can be achieved by using penalized quasi-likelihood (Breslow and Clayton 1993). We used the \texttt{gamm()} function of \texttt{mgcv}, which iteratively calls the \texttt{lme()} function of the \texttt{nlme} package for maximization (Pinheiro et al. 2009). No models could be fitted due to convergence failures (see, e.g., Ruppert, Wand, and Carroll (2003) and Wood (2006) for problems and limitations with this approach). As an alternative, we tried a fixed effect approach (e.g., Wooldridge 2002) but there was no significant change in results. This is also supported by preliminary work demonstrating, e.g., that the temporal correlation in the data is low/mild. Finally, using the classic Schwarz's Bayesian criterion (SBC), we compared model (\ref{PropM}) with one in which the spatial effect was assumed to be additive in time; the latter yielded an increased SBC.  

\subsection{Variance and trend estimation \label{VE}}

Taking a Bayesian view we can construct intervals using the posterior distribution of the model parameters. This approach was originally proposed by Wahba (1983) or Silverman (1985) in the univariate spline model context, and then generalized to the component-wise case when dealing with Gaussian and non-Gaussian data (e.g., Gu 2002; Gu and Wahba 1993; Ruppert, Wand, and Carroll 2003). The interesting feature of these intervals is that since they include both a bias and a variance component (Nychka 1988), they have good observed \textit{frequentist} coverage probabilities across the function as shown, for example, in the simulation experiments of Wang and Wahba (1995). The posterior distribution is given as
\beq
\bm\theta|{\bf y} \dot{\backsim} N( \hat{\bm\theta}, {\bf V}_{\bm\theta} ),
\label{Poster}
\eeq
where $\hat{\bm\theta}$ is the maximum penalized likelihood estimate of $\bm\theta$ obtained as explained in the previous section, which is of the form $(\X\ts{\bf W}\X+{\bf S}^*)^{-1}\X\ts{\bf W}{\bf z}$. ${\bf V}_{\bm\theta} = (\X\ts{\bf W}\X+{\bf S}^*)^{-1}\phi$, $\X$ contains the columns associated with the regression spline bases used to set up the model, and ${\bf W}$ and $\mathbf{z}$ are the diagonal weight matrix and the pseudodata vector at convergence of the algorithm used to fit the penalized model (e.g., Wood 2006, 2010).

Given the result above, it is easy to find confidence intervals for linear functions of the parameters such as smooth components. Intervals for non-linear functions of the model coefficients can be efficiently obtained by simulation from the posterior distribution of $\bm\theta$. Result (\ref{Poster}) can also be used to produce trend estimates as discussed below.

To aid interpretation of the results, trend estimates for some given areas of interest can be produced using the predictive distribution of $\texttt{irf}_{it}$, constructed employing the result of the previous section. This approach has been previously adopted in the literature (e.g., Augustin et al. 2009), and can be implemented as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Repeat the following steps for $b=1,\ldots,N_b$, where $N_b$ represents the number of random draws. 
	   \begin{enumerate}
	      \item Simulate a random $N(\hat{\bm\theta}, \hat{{\bf V}}_{\bm\theta} )$ and call the resulting coefficient vector $\bm\theta_b$.
	      \item Calculate $\widehat{\E(\texttt{irf}_{it})}=\widehat{\texttt{irf}}_{itb}=\exp(\X^*_{it}\bm\theta_b)$, where $\X^*_{it}$ is evaluated at the observed values. 
	      \item For a given area of interest $a$ and year $t$, calculate
	      $$\widehat{\overline{\texttt{irf}}}_{tb}^a=\frac{1}{n_a}\sum_{i=1}^{n_a} \widehat{\texttt{irf}}_{itb}.$$    
	   \end{enumerate}
	\item Produce the required summary statistics, in this case median, lower and upper $95\%$ quantiles, for the temporal trend $\widehat{\overline{\texttt{irf}}}_{tb}^a$.
\end{enumerate}
Small values for $N_b$ are typically tolerable. In practice, $N_b$ can be set to $100$. Increasing this value does not change the results which are presented in the next section.
 

\section{Empirical results \label{ER}}

We now present the results of running the models detailed above. We first look at the results of the model for the incidence of resident foreigners, then the model for the constructed composite indicator. Finally, we discuss the possible connection between these two sets of maps.

\subsection{Spatiotemporal trends \label{STT}}

As mentioned in the introductory section, in Italy, the incidence of foreigners calculated on a national level was 6.5\% in 2008. This information does not tell us anything specific on the presence of areas with particularly high or low levels of resident foreigners. This same interpretation may be involved in the case of a measure of the incidence calculated on a regional or provincial level. This kind of low resolution statistic can mask smaller-scale heterogeneity in the population. Our aim here is to capture exactly this spatial heterogeneity. Figure \ref{fig1} shows the spatiotemporal trend of the incidence of resident foreign population in Italy for the period $2003-2008$. Two features stand out: 1) the distribution of foreigners is not homogeneous in the space and over time, and 2) the striking difference in incidence between north and south. Clearly this inhomogeneous distribution is not captured in the above, national, statistic for incidence. 

\begin{figure}[tbp]

		\includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth, angle=270]{SmoothPlot.eps}
	\caption{Spatial distribution of incidence of resident foreigners in Italy over the years $2003-2008$. Predictions were made over those points lying inside the study region from a 100 by 100 grid.}
	\label{fig1}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[tbp]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{mapIT.eps}
	\caption{Geographical map of Italy and its bordering countries. Source: Google Earth.}
	\label{fig2}
\end{figure}

From Figure \ref{fig1}, we can see that in 2003 the Po Valley (see Figure \ref{fig2}) is the area with the highest incidence of foreigners in Italy. Over the subsequent years ($2004-2008$), the incidence spreads out to form three main and distinct gravitational areas where foreigners have decided to live. Focusing on the last year observed (2008), the first gravitational area is the Po Valley, concerning the regions Emilia--Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lombardy and Veneto. This area appears more expanded in comparison with that of 2003. The second most attractive area is made up of the central Italy regions Tuscany, Umbria, Marche and Lazio, while the third area is composed by Liguria and Piedmont, which are located in the northwest of the country. We also spot an interesting growth in the incidence at the borders with Switzerland and Austria (from about 1\% in 2003 to about $3-4\%$ in 2008). We believe this growth is of interest because the area is characterized by mountains with medium-high altitudes, where, for example, job opportunities and lifestyle are different as compared to those of low-altitude areas. However, in order to explain the appeal of these areas to foreigners further research is needed. Foreigners seem less attracted by the regions and islands of Southern Italy.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth, angle=270]{trends.ps}
	\caption{Temporal trend - Dave please complete here, just describe the plot, no need to say the smoother we used.}
	\label{trends}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{trends}, shows the estimated temporal trends for both the full Italian territory and broken down by area with 95\% confidence intervals. The trends for northern and central Italy are similar. However, those for southern Italy and the islands are much flatter. Northern and central Italy show a faster growth in incidence. This difference is supported by the confidence intervals. Overall, these trends reflect what we see in the maps in Figure \ref{fig2}, that there is a significant difference between northern/central Italy and the south of the country and its islands. 

The maps in Figure \ref{fig1} exhibit interesting spatiotemporal patterns which can be useful for policy-makers to decide the allocation at local level of economic resources in supporting policies and services needed for the process of integration of foreigners in the host country. In this regard, we expect that an area with a high density of resident foreigners requires more economic resources than a low density area. Such policies relate to a number of aspects including the access of resident foreigners to the public health service, admission to education, professional training, services supporting the match of demand and supply of labor, and so on (e.g., Zincone 2006). For sociologists and demographers these maps may represent, instead, a new way to model the spatiotemporal demographic behavior of a population and read graphically the results.

\subsection{Incidence of resident foreigners and spatial economic attractiveness: is there a connection? \label{NEX}}

We now try to explain the considerable observed difference in incidence between north and south. We first briefly describe the construction of a composite indicator of spatial economic attractiveness (ISEA), before moving onto a discussion of whether there is a connection in the spatiotemporal distribution of the incidence of foreigners and ISEA.

\subsubsection{Construction of the indicator of spatial economic attractiveness (ISEA) \label{ISEA}}

We construct a simple composite indicator using three economic variables chosen for their relevance, accuracy, frequency of update and accessibility, as well as coherence with our overall purpose. These variables are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Added value per capita at constant prices (base year 2000):} computed as the ratio of added value at constant prices and number of inhabitants. This variable is typically considered as a proxy measure of standard of living. 

\item \textbf{Unemployment rate:} calculated as the ratio between unemployed workers and total labor force multiplied by 100. This measures the tension in the labor market due to an excess of labor supply (by workers) with respect to labor demand (by companies).

\item \textbf{Employment rate:} computed as the percentage of individuals in the potential working population (age between 15 and 64) who are currently employed.
\end{itemize}

Data were provided by ISTAT, at province level (the highest resolution available). As in OECD (2008), the composite indicator was constructed using principal component analysis (PCA) to define weights for the aggregation of indicators (Hair et al. 2006). The high correlation between the economic variables listed above, further emphasizes the need for such an approach. Before performing PCA, outlier presence was checked. PCA was performed for each year in the period $2003-2008$ using the \texttt{princomp()} function in \texttt{R}. In agreement with both our expectations and the economic theory, coefficients in the first principal component for the added value per capita and employment rate were positive, and negative for unemployment rate. Sign and magnitude of the coefficients were stable for the years investigated (see Figure \ref{fig4}). The eigenvalue of first principal component was greater than unity and explains more than 90\% of the variance; the first component accurately represents the composite indicator of interest ISEA. Since there were no outliers in the standardised scores, they were normalised using a `min-max' procedure (OECD 2008, p. 85), ranking them between 0 to 100. To save space, further details on the results of PCA are available upon request.
 
\begin{figure}[tbp]
\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth, angle=270]{sensitivity.eps}
\caption{Scatter plots of ISEA against each of the economic variables - Dave you can say that these are representative samples! Say also how these plots show that the relations are stable over time, this sensitivity analysis gives some feel of reliability when reading of the results. Say also that these plots concern the first component of PCA.}
	\label{fig4}
\end{figure}

Scatterplots of the composite indicator against its components (see Figure \ref{fig4}) can reveal relationships between the individual indicators and the composite index (OECD 2008, p. 35). A value of ISEA close to 100 corresponds to the highest levels of added value per capita and employment rate and to the lowest levels of unemployment rate. For low values of the indicator we observe the opposite effect. The proposed composite indicator ranks the Italian provinces, on a yearly basis, from the most to the least attractive from both an economic and labor market standpoint.

\subsubsection{Is there a connection between ISEA and incidence of resident foreign? \label{nexus}}

Figure \ref{fig5} shows spatiotemporal maps of the ISEA, obtained using the same methodology as in Section \ref{METH}. Results for Sardinia are not available due to the too low number of observations available to fit the model. The maps show a clear gradient running from the highest levels in the north to the lowest in the south. 

\begin{figure}[tbp]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth, angle=270]{index.eps}
	\caption{Spatial distribution of the ISEA for the years $2003-2008$. Predictions were made over those points lying inside the study region from a 100 by 100 grid.}
	\label{fig5}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig4}'s scatterplots supports the maps of Figure \ref{fig5}. For example, values of ISEA above 80 (located in the north of the country) are associated to an added value per capita around 20-30000 euros. A much lower added value is given for values of ISEA below 30 (located in the south of the country). Over the period of observation, the employment rates of Italian southern provinces registered levels below 50\%. These are quite far from the target of 70\% by 2010 as specified by the Lisbon Strategy in March 2000. In addition, despite a more flexible labor market of recent years, which led to a reduction in the unemployment at national level, the southern provinces continue to register the highest and most persistent levels of unemployment as comapared to north Italy (e.g., Zanin and Marra 2010). This suggests a greater difficulty for south regions to absorb the labor supply. Other empirical studies on the dynamics of the added value (e.g., Luciano 2004; Petacchini 2008; Daniele 2009), employment (e.g., Guisan and Aguayo, 2002) and unemployment (e.g., Brunello, Lupi and Ordine, 2001; Cracolici, Cuffaro and Nijkamp, 2007, 2009) suggest that these gaps between north and south Italy have a structural nature. In this regard, we would expect a higher incidence of foreigners in areas with high ISEA values and vice versa. This is supported by the primary reason why foreigners are in Italy: employment (Fullin and Reyneri 2010). Following this, foreigners should take up residence in places where there are jobs available to them. If we overlay Figure \ref{fig2} onto Figure \ref{fig5}, we can see that there is a clear connection between incidence of resident foreigners and the values of ISEA. Areas with a higher level of the composite indicator have the highest incidence of foreigners, and vice versa. 

As a possible extension to a qualitative analysis, this relationship could be tested statistically using model (\ref{PropM}) and adding the composite indicator as an exogenous variable. However, as discussed in Section \ref{ISEA}, given the computational constraints and differing spatial resolution of the quantities being modeled (the incidence of foreigners is available at a municipality level, while the composite indicator at a provincial level), we have considered the two analyses separately. We recall that the main aim of this study is to model the spatiotemporal distribution of the resident foreign population. The proposed indicator can contribute to explain some of the observed spatial heterogeneity, but it represents only one of many possible avenues to explore.

In summary: we suggested a tool for practitioners to provide spatiotemporal maps modeling the distribution of the incidence of foreigners in the territory over space and time, and time trends with confidence bands. We also constructed a composite indicator representing economic and labor market factors to explain some of the observed spatial heterogeneity. Our results complement previous findings and can help policy makers to decide the allocation at local level of economic resources supporting, e.g., the process of integration of resident foreigners in a host country. Should some relevant economic variables become available at municipal level, different model specifications incorporating covariate effects could be considered. Here we considered the Italian case but the same analysis can be reproduced for other countries and different contexts.
