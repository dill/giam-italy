\section{Introduction \label{IN}}

Increased political interest, as well as academic interest has lead to a large volume of both theoretical and applied work regarding international migration: its causes and implications for both natives and foreigners. Here our emphasis is to provide a tool for practitioners to provide spatial information for policy formulation. We first provide a review of previous work on the area, before moving into the details of our proposal.

Several migration theories have been proposed in the literature, from both a macro- and micro-economic point of view, based on different schools of thought. Examples include: the neoclassical economic theory (based on both geographic differences in wages and working conditions rather than on a cost/benefit analysis e.g., Borjas 1989; Massey et al. 1993), the assumptions regarding the new economics of migration (in which the decision to migrate is taken at household level, and the aim is to maximise incomes and to minimise risks, e.g., Stark and Bloom 1985; Massey et al. 1993), dual labor markets (in which international migrations are linked to labour demand in modern industrialised societies, e.g., Piore 1979; Massey et al. 1993) and world systems theory (underpinned by the notion that immigration is the natural consequence of a globalised economy, e.g., Wallerstein 1974; Portes and Walton 1981; Morawska 1990; Hooghe et al. 2008). Massey et al. (1993) claim that migration perpetuates migration via migrant networks which connect migrants and non-migrants in both origin and destination regions through interpersonal ties such as friendship, shared community origin or employment.

In addition to theoretical work, many empirical cases have been analyzed. A non-exhaustive list of examples includes: studies investigating the impact of foreigners on the labor market of the host country (e.g., Borjas 1994, 2003, 2005; Borjas, Freeman and Katz 1996; Card 2005; Fullin and Reyneri 2010), underemployment (Slack and Jensen 2007), possible connections between immigration and nations' poverty rates (Raphael and Smolensky 2009), transfer of identity from the first to second generation immigrants (Casey and Dustmann 2010), difference in education, earnings and employment between first and second generation immigrants (Algan et al. 2010), problems relating to the integration of different cultures and languages (e.g., Lazer 1999; Contucci and Ghirlanda 2007), and the tendency for immigrants to live in ethnic ``enclaves'' (Edin, Fredriksson and Aslund 2003). 

Despite the increasing amount of  literature on international migration, to the best of our knowledge no studies have attempted to model the spatiotemporal distribution of the incidence of resident foreigners in a country. The results of such an investigation complement previous findings, and should help to guide governmental policy. 

In the special issue of \textit{The Economic Journal} dedicated to `the integration of immigrants and its consequences', Manning (2010) observes that many European countries are currently experiencing a significant increase in immigrants in their populations. Here we consider the Italian case. 


Between the 1991 and 2001 censuses, the incidence of resident foreigners in the total population was increased from $0.6\%$ to $2.3\%$. According to the Italian National Statistical Office (ISTAT), over the period $2002-2008$, this indicator has increased from $2.7\%$ to $6.5\%$. In particular, between 2002 and 2004 the increase in incidence was partly driven by the regularisation process of previously illegal immigrants as part of new legislation (law no. 189/2002; see Zincone (2002) for further details). Clearly, these data are indicative of a recent increase in the presence of foreigners in Italy.

This increase has lead to both socio-demographic and economic changes in Italy. For example, recent official statistics have highlighted an increase in marriage between Italians and foreigners; the number of entrepreneurs with foreign citizenship has also increased. The projections up to 2050 produced by ISTAT suggest a continuing, substantial increase in numbers of resident foreigners (about $17\%$ of the total population by 2050), as is the case in many European countries (e.g., Alders, Keilman and Cruijsen 2007). 

It is therefore of paramount importance to formulate adequate social policies which can support, for example, the process of integrating immigrants into their host country by promoting recognition and respect for different cultural identities. This contributes to ensuring community cohesion between foreign and native people, and thus avoids social unrest (e.g., Cheong et al. 2007; Van Der Veer 2003). Policy and law are typically key drivers in providing this. Immigrants' rights and integration policies typically relate to specific laws regarding public health and education (e.g., Zincone 2006). Taking a wider view, though, policies may also relate to professional training and the right to housing, as well as guidance and counselling on legal issues and administrative procedures. When forming policy, knowledge of where experience should be drawn from, where pilot schemes should be run and where funding should be allocated is vital. The spatiotemporal maps produced using the proposed approach provide important insights into this matter for practitioners.

The information is reported in terms of number (divided by 1000) and incidence of resident foreigners. Both variables are calculated at the end of December of each year, except for 2001 which is obtained from the population census (October $21^{th}$). The average, low and high scenarios are by the solid and dotted lines, respectively.}

As a measure of density of the foreign population, we use the incidence of resident foreigners calculated as
\beq
\% \ incidence \ of \ resident \ foreigners_j  = \frac{number \ of \ resident \ foreigners_j}{total \ resident \ population_j} \times 100
\label{first.d1}
\eeq
where $j$ denotes a specific area such municipality, province, or region (e.g., De Bartolo 2007; Lowell 2007; Coleman 2008; Miguet 2008). This gives a simple, well-known, demographic indicator for comparing different regions of a country in terms of number of foreigners per 100 resident inhabitants. It can be thought of as indicative of the spatial distribution of foreigners and thus identify areas of the country with a greater or lesser presence of resident foreigners in the population (e.g., OECD 2004). If such distribution is unbalanced in space and time, then there are most likely factors that attract more foreigners to that area as opposed to another. In fact, inhomogeneous spatial incidence may be explained by several factors. Such characteristics include the presence of foreigners with the same origin (e.g., recall the network theory, above), abundance of affordable housing, the economic prosperity of the area (e.g., in terms of employment, income, etc.), and so on.

To assess what draws foreigners to one particular area over another, it is useful to have some quantitative measure of the ``attractiveness'' of each area to foreigners. We focus on economic and labour market factors, construct a composite indicator that we have named Index of Spatial Economic Attractiveness (ISEA) and produce spatiotemporal maps of the index. Three important variables constitute the index: (i) added value per capita, (ii) unemployment rate and (iii) employment rate. Since these are typically readily available, this composite indicator can be easily constructed for many countries. The results can be analyzed in the light of the spatiotemporal maps of the incidence of resident foreigners.

The novel empirical analysis proposed in this article addresses the points discussed above. Our study is carried out using ISTAT data for Italy over the period 2003-2008. Since 2003, ISTAT has provided a public database with annual frequency of the number of resident foreigners at a municipal level. This new data represents the current maximum spatial and temporal detail available. Spatiotemporal modelling can be achieved via the use of splines which can perform smoothing over some bounded domain $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$, over time (e.g., Hastie and Tibshirani 1990; Ruppert, Wand, and Carroll 2003; Wood 2006). Here, the response (incidence of resident foreigners) is modelled as a function of time and spatial coordinates. The model can then be used to create smooth maps of the geographical area of interest over time. Two points are noteworthy here. 

First, when a geographical region has complex boundaries, as in many applied contexts, features from one part of the domain can unduly influence other parts giving rise to a phenomenon known as \textit{leakage} (e.g., Ramsay 2002). Leakage typically occurs when a smoother inappropriately links two parts of a domain causing the fitted surface to be mis-estimated, hence leading to incorrect inference (e.g., biased incidence estimates), which is clearly not desirable. This issue can be overcome if the smoother used can account for the structure of the domain that is under investigation; several solutions have been proposed (Ramsay 2002; Wood, Bravington and Hedley 2008, and references therein). 

Second, given that it is unlikely that the spatial trend of incidence of resident foreigners is additive in time, the employed approach should account for a space-time interaction. These two goals can be jointly achieved by using a scale-invariant three-dimensional tensor product smoother combining a cubic regression spline basis function for time trend and a soap film spline basis for the spatial dimensions (Wood 2006; Wood, Bravington and Hedley 2008).

The remainder of the article is organised as follows...


\section{Data \label{DAT}}

\subsection{Overview \label{SDC}}

The entry of foreigners from some countries of the European Union (EU) into Italy is regulated by the Schengen agreements. These allow for the elimination of border controls, hence creating a common area of free movement among the state members (e.g., Broeders 2007). Foreigners from a non-EU country must possess a visa or the necessary documents (for further details see the official website of the Ministry of the Interior http://www.interno.it). 
 
At this point, we must distinguish between those individuals considered to be the resident foreign population and those considered to be immigrants. The foreign population includes all people (born in Italy or abroad), who declare their citizenship to not be Italian. 

The immigrant population, consists of all those born abroad who have declared to be foreigners or Italian by naturalisation (ie. those who declare themselves to be a nationality other than Italian on the census). The foreigners born in Italy such as children born from foreign parents, are excluded from immigrant population. However, the population census of 2001 showed that foreigners and immigrants largely match ({\bf WHAT do you mean by match here?}SEE POINT 10 OF ATTACHED PDF). About $81\%$ og immigrants has been identified by foreign citizenship, and $88\%$ of foreigners are immigrants because they were born abroad.

In many countries, official statistics report the number resident foreigners, but not the number of immigrants(Coleman 2008). Currently, the dynamics of immigration to Italy still allows the acceptance of a definition which does not distinguish between these two groups. This simplification is reasonable in the first phase of the immigration process in a country, and when the majority of immigrants keep their own citizenship for a long period. Indeed, this is the case in Italy. The population census gives the best distinction between immigrants and foreigners. In this case the data can be analysed by birthplace, citizenship at birth, and citizenship at the census time. 
 
Italian official statistics on resident foreign population are mainly based on administrative sources which are linked to specific laws. Recently, ISTAT has integrated the official statistics with a new public database (http://demo.istat.it). The database gives the total number of resident foreigners calculated at the end of December of each year, for each municipality (of which there are around 8100). For each municipality, measure (\ref{first.d1}) was calculated for each year in the period $2003-2008$. Compared to provincial or regional data, municipal-level data offers far more detail on the spatial distribution of the foreigners in the total population.
 
As well known in demographic science, populations are dynamic over time as well as space. To account for this we also include temporal information in our model. The change in number of foreign people, at the end of a year, is determined by
$$
\text{RFP}^{31^\text{th}}_{jy} = \text{RFP}^{1^\text{st}}_{jy} + (I_1 + I_2 + I_3+ I_4) - (D_1 + D_2 + D_3 + D_4 + AC).
$$ 
$\text{RFP}^{31^\text{th}}_{jy}$ indicates the total number of resident foreigners at the end of December in the $j^\text{th}$ Italian municipality for the $y^\text{th}$ year, and $\text{RFP}^{1^\text{st}}_{jy}$ the number of resident foreigners (in the same municipality, $j$ and year, $y$) on the $1^\text{st}$ of January. $I_{1}$ denotes the number of people whose parents are foreigners (at least one of them being resident in the municipality), $I_{2}$ the number of foreign citizens who asked to transfer their residence from another Italian municipality to the current one, $I_{3}$ those who asked to transfer their residence from abroad, and $I_{4}$ refers to recording operations due to other reasons (e.g. foreigners mistakenly deleted from the registry of the municipality, because they were temporarily missing). $D_{1}$ represents the number of resident foreigners who died during the year, $D_{2}$ those who moved to a different municipality, $D_{3}$ those who moved abroad, $D_{4}$ refers to cancellations for other reasons (e.g., foreigners deleted from the registry of the municipality, because they were not present), and \textit{AC} denotes those resident foreigners who obtained Italian citizenship during the year. 

Acquisition of Italian citizenship by foreigners is regulated by law 91 of the $5^\text{th}$ of February 1992 and its subsequent amendments and additions. Foreigners can acquire the Italian citizenship by marriage to an Italian or by `naturalisation'. This last case refers to the situation in which the foreigner has lived in the country from a certain period of time. Such a period varies dependent on the status of the person in question. For example the period is at least 10 years for non-EU citizens, at least 4 years for EU citizens or at least 5 years for political refugees or stateless persons and adult individuals who been adopted by Italian citizens. An exhaustive list of ways to obtain Italian citizenship is available on the Ministry of the Interior's website.

Once foreigners have acquired Italian citizenship, they are included in the Italian population's statistics. Currently, no information is available on the number of resident Italian citizens separated by origin. In the opinion of the authors, were this information available a very interesting study could be conducted. For instance, this information could be useful for monitoring the ethnic and cultural diversity in the population. However, the multi-ethnic or multi-cultural aspect is not addressed here.

The phenomenon of illegal immigrants (e.g., Carter 1999; Hillman and Weiss 1999; De Bartolo 2007; Bchir 2008; Cangiano 2008) and its respective quantification (e.g., Strozza 2004) is also a very important issue for policy-makers and scholars. In this case, those entering the country are not in possession of a visa, the necessary documents or a valid permission to be in that country. Several approaches have been proposed to quantify this phenomenon, but all are subject to criticism (especially with regard to the magnitude of errors in the estimates). For this reason, we only make use of the official data on the resident foreign population, hence avoiding the possible introduction of factors which are not directly controllable and quantifiable which could bias our results. 


\subsection{The foreign population's contribution to Italy's demography \label{DEM}}

Bijak et al. (2007) shows that in the absence of migration, many of the 27 European countries could see a decline in the resident population up to 2052. In particular, under this assumption, they estimate that the population of Italy could decrease from 57 million in 2002 to about 43 million in 2052. The main causes of population decline in Italy may be linked to: (i) an ageing population and (ii) a low fertility rate. 

Looking population structure first, the ratio of old (over 64) to young (up to 14) in the total population was 143.4 at the end of 2008 (156.2 if we only consider individuals with Italian citizenship). The elderly population is about $43\%$ larger than the young population. Considering only resident foreign population the ratio is 11.2. From this we conclude that there is a substantial difference in the age structures of population present in Italy, if we stratify by citizenship.

As for the low fertility rate, the latest data from ISTAT puts the average number of children per Italian women of childbearing age (from 15 to 49 years) at 1.33; lower than the average of 2.05 children for foreign women living in Italy. Combining the fertility rate for both Italian and foreign women, we obtain an average of 1.41. Coleman (2008) states that ``typically, in low-mortality populations a total fertility of about 2.04 is regarded as the `replacement level', that is, a level sufficient to replace the population in the long-run, ignoring migration''. Given the impact of foreigners on the population structure, the measure of total fertility (and hence the level of replacement) must take into account the contribution of immigrants (Coleman 2008). The increasing presence of foreigners in Italy over recent years has contributed not only to population growth, but also to a reduction in average age and an improvement in the total fertility rate.

The profile of the nationalities of resident foreigners in Italy is changing. In 2003, the top three countries of origin were Albania ($13.6\%$), Morocco ($12.7\%$) and Romania ($8.9\%$). In 2008, Romania was top ($20.5\%$), followed by Albania ($11.3\%$) and Morocco ($10.4\%$). The significant increase of the Romanian population in Italy coincides with the country's entry to the European Union ($1^\text{th}$ January 2007). Currently, Romanian is the predominant foreign nationality in 14 of the 20 Italian regions. Italy hosts the largest Romanian community outside Romania and almost half of the entire Romanian migrant stock (Ban 2009). The choice of Italy as primary destination for Romanians can be explained by many factors including the presence of small Italian companies, the economic links with in Romania, and the accessibility of the Italian language for Romanians. 

According to a descriptive analysis of data from ISTAT, in 2008 the resident foreign population in Italy was made up of $53.6\%$ individuals from the Europe, $22.4\%$ from Africa, $15.8\%$ from Asia, $8.1\%$ from America, and $0.1\%$ from Oceania.

\section{Methodology \label{METH}}

\subsection{Model specification \label{MS}}

The model we employ belongs to the class of generalized additive models (GAMs, Hastie and Tibshirani 1990). Such models allow for complex, non-linear relationships between covariates and the response, which are crucial to uncover interesting features in the data. The incidence of resident foreigners exhibits a positively skewed distribution; for this reason a gamma distribution provides a realistic description of the response variable. The proposed model is as follows
\beq
\text{log}\left\{\E(\texttt{irf}_{it})\right\} = f(\texttt{year}_t,\texttt{n}_i,\texttt{e}_i), \quad \texttt{irf}_{it} \sim \text{Gamma},          
\label{PropM}
\eeq
for $i=1,\ldots,8094$ and $t=1,\ldots,6$. The log link function ensures positive fitted values. $\texttt{irf}_{it}$, $\texttt{n}_i$, and $\texttt{e}_i$ represent the variables percentage incidence of resident foreigners, Northing, and Easting, respectively. The function $f$ is a multidimensional smooth of \texttt{year}, \texttt{n}, and \texttt{e} which models the joint effect of these variables on \texttt{irf}. Northing and Easting are simply offsets in kilometres from a set point, thus ensuring that the spatial part of the smooth is isotropic (as opposed to using latitude and longitude). We want both the space and time dimension to have an optimal degree of smoothness in terms of the bias-variance trade-off; the chosen smoother has to be invariant to the relative scaling of space (km) and time (years). This can be achieved by using a multidimensional tensor product smooth combining a cubic regression spline basis for \texttt{year} and an \textit{isotropic} soap film spline basis for the two spatial dimensions \texttt{n} and \texttt{e}, since the smoother should not depend on the coordinate system used and account for the structure of the geographical domain under investigation (details are given in the next two sections). The smooth component in (\ref{PropM}) is subject to identifiability constraints; see Wood (2006) for more details.

The next two sections cover the technical details of the construction of the smoothers. We first show how, in general a three-dimensional tensor product smoother can be constructed using a two-dimensional spatial smoother and a one-dimensional temporal smoother. We then go into the details of how the two-dimensional smoother is constructed in our case, to wit, the soap film smoother.

\subsection{A three-dimensional tensor product smoother for time and space \label{3D}}

The construction of a three-dimensional scale invariant tensor product smoother of time and space is based on a marginal one-dimensional spline basis for time and a two-dimensional marginal smooth for space, with associated quadratic penalties measuring their roughness. We omit the subscripts $i$ and $t$ for simplicity. Let us assume that we have two low-rank regression spline bases of any type to represent the smooth functions $f_\text{year}$ and $f_\text{space}$, we can write (e.g., Ruppert, Wand and Carroll 2003; Wood 2006)
$$
f_\text{year}(\texttt{year})=\sum_{l=1}^L \xi_l b_l(\texttt{year})=\textbf{X}_\text{year}\bm\xi \ \ \text{and} \ \ f_\text{space}(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})=\sum_{r=1}^R \varphi_r d_r(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})=\textbf{X}_\text{space}\bm\varphi,
$$
where the $b_l(\texttt{year})$ and $d_r(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ are known cubic regression spline and soap film basis functions, with corresponding parameters $\xi_l$ and $\varphi_r$ and spline dimensions $L$ and $R$. $\textbf{X}_\text{year}$ and $\textbf{X}_\text{space}$ are marginal model matrices evaluating the basis functions with parameter vectors $\bm\xi$ and $\bm\varphi$. 

The expansion for $f_\text{space}$ and its roughness penalty do not correspond exactly to the expressions used to set up the model since, in this section, we are concerned with illustrating the construction of a three-dimensional scale invariant tensor product smoother. It is therefore convenient to keep the description of the two-dimensional marginal smooth for space and its quadratic penalty as simple as possible, leaving a rigorous description will be given in the next section. 

In order to set up a three-dimensional tensor product smoother for time and space we need $f_\text{year}(\texttt{year})$ to vary smoothly within the space dimensions. This can be achieved by allowing the parameters $\xi_l$ to vary smoothly with \texttt{n} and \texttt{e}. Using the spline set-up for $f_\text{space}(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ we may write (e.g., Wood 2006, p. 163)
$$
\xi_l(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})=\sum_{r=1}^R \varphi_{lr} d_r(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})
$$    
which results in
$$
f(\texttt{year},\texttt{n},\texttt{e})=\sum_{l=1}^L \sum_{r=1}^R \varphi_{lr} d_r(\texttt{n},\texttt{e}) b_l(\texttt{year}). 
$$
For any particular set of observations of \texttt{year}, \texttt{n}, and \texttt{e}, there exists a simple relationship between the matrix $\textbf{X}$ evaluating the tensor product smooth at these observations, and the model matrices $\textbf{X}_\text{year}$ and $\textbf{X}_\text{space}$ evaluating the marginal smooths at the same observations. Ordering appropriately the parameters $\varphi_{lr}$ into a vector $\bm\theta$, the $i^{th}$ row of $\textbf{X}$ is given by $\textbf{X}_{i}=\textbf{X}_\text{year,i}\otimes\textbf{X}_\text{space,i}$, where $\otimes$ is the Kronecker product. 

In the GAM context, it is necessary to quantify the roughness of the smooth functions in the model so that over-fitting can be accounted for and hence avoided during the parameter estimation process (e.g., Marra and Radice 2010). As for the penalty associated with this tensor product basis, it is possible to start from roughness measures associated with the marginal smooths $f_\text{year}(\texttt{year})$ and $f_\text{space}(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$. Suppose that functionals $Js$ measuring the roughness of the smooth terms are available, and that these can be written as quadratic forms in the marginal parameters, we have that
$$
J_\text{year}(f_\text{year})=\bm\xi\ts\textbf{S}_\text{year}\bm\xi \ \ \text{and} \ \ J_\text{space}(f_\text{space})=\bm\varphi\ts\textbf{S}_\text{space}\bm\varphi,
$$
where the $\textbf{S}$ matrices contain known coefficients whose values depend on the chosen bases for time and space. For instance, the second-order cubic spline penalty for $f_\text{year}(\texttt{year})$ evaluates $J_\text{year}(f_\text{year})=\int\left( \partial^2 f_\text{year}/\partial \texttt{year}^2 \right)^2 d\texttt{year}$, but it may be more complex (Wood 2006, 2008). Following, e.g., Zanin and Marra (2010), an overall penalty for the tensor product smooth can be obtained by applying the penalties of $f_\text{space}(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ to the varying coefficients of the marginal smooth $f_\text{year}(\texttt{year})$, $\xi_l(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$,
$$
\sum_{l=1}^L J_\text{space}\left\{  \xi_l(\texttt{n},\texttt{e}) \right\},
$$ 
and the penalties of $f_\text{year}(\texttt{year})$ to the varying coefficients of the marginal smooth $f_\text{space}(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$, $\varphi_r(\texttt{year})$,  
$$
\sum_{r=1}^R J_\text{year}\left\{  \varphi_r(\texttt{year}) \right\}.
$$ 
It follows that the roughness penalty of $f(\texttt{year},\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ can be measured as 
$$
\lambda_\text{space} \sum_{l=1}^L J_\text{space}\left\{  \xi_l(\texttt{n},\texttt{e}) \right\} + \lambda_\text{year} \sum_{r=1}^R J_\text{year}\left\{  \varphi_r(\texttt{year}) \right\},
$$
which can also be written as
$$
\lambda_\text{space} \bm\theta\ts \textbf{I}_L \otimes \textbf{S}_\text{space} \bm\theta + \lambda_\text{year} \bm\theta\ts \textbf{S}_\text{year} \otimes \textbf{I}_R  \bm\theta,
$$
where, once again, the vector $\bm\theta$ contains the tensor product smooth parameters. The $\lambda$ are smoothing parameters controlling the trade-off between model fit and model smoothness. The next section shows how $f_\text{space}$ and $\textbf{S}_\text{space}$ can be constructed.   

This expression gives the tensor product penalty in the most general terms. However, in order to have an expression which can be later related to the soap film smoother, we re-express the penalty as:
$$
\bm\theta\ts \textbf{I}_L \otimes \textbf{S}^*_\text{space} \bm\theta + \bm\theta\ts \textbf{S}^*_\text{year} \otimes \textbf{I}_R  \bm\theta,
$$
where $\textbf{S}^*_\text{space}=\lambda_\text{space} \textbf{S}_\text{space}$ and $\textbf{S}^*_\text{year}=\lambda_\text{year} \textbf{S}_\text{year}$.


\subsubsection{Soap film \label{SF}}

As alluded to above, the smoother used for the spatial part of the model must take into account of the fact that the borders of Italy represent both physical and administrative geographic features. Clearly a rather na\"ive model would smooth over the bounding box encompassing all of the region we wish to draw inference on, this is not useful; first, because there are no resident foreigners in the sea (at best there are merely potential resident foreigners) and second, because smoothing over this whole area would cause leakage, as mentioned in the introduction.

Leakage occurs when a smoother inappropriately links two pats of a domain, this can happen when a two peninsulae jut out into the sea with different population densities on either side. Say one has a very high density, where as the other is significantly lower. Most smoothers will not respect that the two areas are different and should be treated so. Rather, the model will ``smooth across'' this gap, causing the high functional values to ``leak'' into the low valued peninsula and vice versa. There are, of course, situations in which leakage is appropriate. For example, in a study of the propagation of a chemical through a river system, there are several mechanisms to transport the chemical (e.g., surface water flow, animals) other than the river itself. Therefore there must be a motivation for why we wish to use a model that specifically prevents leakage. This is the case here, as there is no particular reason we should believe that the foreign population should be continuous across physical boundaries such as the Mediterranean Sea.

The soap film smoother (Wood, Bravington and Hedley 2008) uses a rather simple physical model to prevent leakage from occurring. First, consider the domain boundary to be made of wire, then dip this wire into a bucket of soapy water, you will then have a soap film in the same shape as the boundary. Now consider the wire to lie in the $\texttt{n}$-$\texttt{e}$ plane and the height of the soap film at a given point to be the functional value of the model. This film is then distorted smoothly by moving it vertically toward each datum locally, while minimising the surface tension in the film as a whole. The domain ($\Omega$) is bounded by some polygon ($B$) which, in this case is the coastlines. The boundary conditions on $B$ are estimated using a cyclic spline (Wood 2006, p. 151).

In order to perform soap film smoothing, we must first construct two sets of basis functions to form a smoother that conforms to the necessary boundary conditions. The first basis is used for the smoothing within the region of interest ($\Omega$); the second is for finding the values on the boundary (i.e., smoothing on $B$ itself). These bases are then summed to form
\beq
f_\text{space}(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})=\sum_{j=1}^J \alpha_j a_j(\texttt{n},\texttt{e}) + \sum_{k=1}^K \gamma_k g_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e}),
\eeq
where the $\gamma_k$ and $\alpha_j$ are the parameters to be estimated. One can think of the $a_j(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ as an offset dictated by the estimated boundary conditions on $B$ (although it is important to note, they are not planes) and the sum of the $g_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ as the smooth to the data inside $\Omega$. For convenience later, we label the second sum as $f_\text{int}$. We now show how these bases are constructed.

For the internal part of the smooth we first find a set of functions $\rho_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$, which are each solutions to the Laplace equation in two dimensions
\beq
\frac{\partial^2\rho}{\partial \texttt{n}^2} + \frac{\partial^2\rho}{\partial \texttt{e}^2} = 0
\eeq
except at one of the knots ($\texttt{n}^*_k,\texttt{e}^*_k$). Then, we solve Poisson's equation in 2-dimensions
\beq
\frac{\partial^2 g_k}{\partial \texttt{n}^2} + \frac{\partial^2 g_k}{\partial \texttt{e}^2} = \rho_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})
\label{soap-poisson}
\eeq
for $k$ indexing the $K$ knots. When the boundary condition $\rho_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})=0$ is applied, the set of basis functions for the soap film smoother, $g_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ is found.  The PDEs are solved numerically using successive overrelaxation (see the appendix of Wood, Bravington and Hedley 2008 for further details).

To find the boundary basis we first take a a `boundary function', $f_\text{bnd}(r)$, using cyclic splines. The function evaluates the height of the function at each point around the boundary. $f_\text{bnd}(r)$ will have the expansion
\beq
f_\text{bnd}(r)=\sum_{j=1}^J \alpha_j \delta_j(r),
\label{soap-cyclic}
\eeq
where $r$ is the distance along the boundary, the $\alpha_j$ are parameters and $\delta_j$ are known cubic spline basis functions. To ensure that the spline is cyclic the usual constraint is enforced: that the value of the function at the first knot is the same as that at the last knot up to their second derivatives. Note that we don't find the $\alpha_j$ at this stage, for now we are only interested in the expansion. The basis functions $a_j(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ themselves can be found by solving (\ref{soap-poisson}) for $\rho_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})\equiv 0$ with the boundary condition resulting from setting $\alpha_j=1$ (and all other $\alpha_i$ to zero) in (\ref{soap-cyclic}), using the same methods as for the $g_k(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$, above. The $a_j(\texttt{n},\texttt{e})$ can be thought of as the set of functions with a peak at each of the $J$ points around the boundary in turn which are smooth across the whole of $\Omega$.

We have now found the set of basis functions for the inside of the domain and also the boundary-induced-smooth which acts as a base for the soap film smoother. Although this seems like a rather esoteric setup, all the procedure above is effectively doing is setting up a basis in order that we can use standard penalized regression techniques. Just as we might chose one spline basis over another for some property it possesses,  the soap film basis has the property that it obeys the (estimated) boundary conditions of the region we are smoothing over.

As with the basis, the penalty is split into two parts: one for the cyclic smooth around the boundary and one for the internal smooth. Writing $\bm\beta$ as the vector of all smooth coefficients for the soap film, $\bm\gamma$ for the boundary smooth parameters and $\bm\alpha$ for the interior, we have
$$
\bm\beta^\text{T}\textbf{S}^*_\text{space}\bm{\beta} = \lambda_\text{bnd} \bm\gamma^\text{T}\textbf{S}_\text{bnd}\bm{\gamma} + \lambda_\text{int} \bm{\alpha}^\text{T}\textbf{S}_\text{int}\bm{\alpha},
$$
where 
$$
\textbf{S}^*_\text{space} = \lambda_\text{bnd} \textbf{S}_\text{bnd} + \lambda_\text{int} \textbf{S}_\text{int}.
$$
$\textbf{S}^*_\text{space}$ is the total penalty for the spatial part of the smooth, $\textbf{S}_\text{int}$ is the interior penalty and $\textbf{S}_\text{bnd}$ is the cyclic spline boundary penalty. Both are matrices of known coefficients depending on the chosen basis functions. The $\lambda$ are the smoothing parameters for the boundary and interior smooths respectively. As in the previous section, an asterisk indicates that the penalty matrices have been multiplied by the appropriate smoothing parameters, this is done for mathematical el. We now look at the two parts of the penalty individually. 

The isotropic interior penalty term is calculated as
$$
\textbf{S}_\text{int} = \int_\Omega \Big(\frac{\partial^2 f_\text{int}}{\partial \texttt{n}^2}+\frac{\partial^2 f_\text{int}}{\partial \texttt{e}^2} 
\Big)^2\text{d}\texttt{n}\text{d}\texttt{e},
$$
Note that the integration occurs only over $\Omega$, rather than over the whole of $\mathbb{R}^n$ as would usually be the case. Also, there is no mixed derivative term, and the whole integrand is squared rather than each term individually (in contrast with, say, a thin plate spline, see Wood (2003)). This allows the $\texttt{n}$ and $\texttt{e}$ term's derivatives to be traded off against each other so the nullspace of the penalty is infinite dimensional. This allows those functions in the nullspace to be sufficiently wiggly to meet any boundary conditions. 

The penalty for the cyclic spline running about the boundary, used to calculate the $\alpha_j$ is calculated as
\beq
\textbf{S}_\text{bnd} = \int_B \Big(\frac{\partial^2 f_\text{bnd}}{\partial r^2}\Big)^2 \text{d}r.
\eeq
See Wood (2006) for further details.

The solution of the PDEs above, yielding the basis and penalty, is the most computationally expensive part of the procedure. Knots to use for $\texttt{n}_k^*$ and $\texttt{e}_k^*$ must be specified, here we use a grid (further detail on our exact setup is given below). In summary, we now have both the basis functions $a_j(\texttt{n}_i,\texttt{e}_i)$ and $g_j(\texttt{n}_i,\texttt{e}_i)$, and the penalties $\textbf{S}_\text{bnd}$ and $\textbf{S}_\text{int}$, forming $\textbf{S}^*_\text{space}$, for the soap film smoother. 

\subsection{Parameter estimation \label{PE}}

In model (\ref{PropM}), replacing $f$ with its tensor product expression yields a generalized linear model (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) whose design matrix contains the spline bases representing the smooth component in the model. In principle such a model can simply be estimated by maximum likelihood (ML). However, in a smoothing spline context, unpenalized parameter estimation is likely to result in smooth component estimates that are too `wiggly', hence undermining the utility of such a model. This can be overcome by penalized ML, where the use of penalties allows for the suppression of that part of smooth term complexity which has no support from the data (e.g., Marra and Radice 2010). Specifically, the model can be fitted by minimization of
\beq
D(\bm\theta) + \bm\theta\ts\textbf{S}^*\bm\theta \ \  \text{w.r.t.} \ \  \bm\theta,
\label{Dev}
\eeq
where $\bm\theta$ contains all tensor product smooth parameters associated with the one-dimensional spline basis for time and two-dimensional smooth for space, and $\textbf{S}^*=\sum_i \lambda_i \textbf{S}_i$, where the $\textbf{S}_i$ are matrices of known coefficients properly defined according to the results of the previous sections with associated smoothing parameters $\lambda_i$. The model deviance, $D$, is defined as $2\phi(l_{\text{sat}}-l)$, where $\phi$ is a dispersion parameter, $l$ is the log-likelihood of the model and $l_{\text{sat}}$ the maximum value for the log-likelihood of the model with one parameter per datum. 

Given values for the $\lambda_i$, minimization of (\ref{Dev}) is straightforward. However, smoothing parameter estimation has to be addressed. This can be achieved by minimization of a prediction error estimate, such as the generalized cross-validation (GCV) (Craven and Wahba 1979), or by approximate restricted ML (REML) estimation (Wood 2010). Smoothing parameter selection via the GCV consists of minimizing 
\beq
V(\bm\lambda)=\frac{nD(\hat{\bm\theta})}{\left\{n-\text{tr}(\textbf{F})\right\}^2},
\label{GCV1}
\eeq
where $\textbf{F}$ is the usual hat matrix, and $\text{tr}(\textbf{F})$ represents the effective degrees of freedom (edf) or number of estimated parameters of the penalized model. Wood (2006) described a computational procedure to estimate smoothing parameters on the basis of criterion (\ref{GCV1}). As an alternative, approximate REML can be employed. Within this framework, the penalized likelihood estimates, $\hat{\bm\theta}$, can be seen as the posterior modes of the distribution of $\bm\theta|{\bf y}$ if $\bm\theta \sim N(\textbf{0},(\textbf{S}^*)^{-1})$, where ($\textbf{S}^*)^{-1}$ is an appropriate generalized inverse. Viewing the spline parameters as random effects allows for the possibility to estimate the $\lambda_i$ via REML (Wahba 1985). The recent work by Reiss and Ogden (2009) shows that at finite sample sizes GCV is prone to undersmoothing and is more likely to develop multiple minima than REML. Therefore, we employ REML given its practical advantages for smoothing parameter selection. We use the \texttt{gam()} function of the \texttt{R} package \texttt{mgcv} since approximate REML optimization for GAMs is reliably and efficiently implemented (Wood 2010). During the model fitting process, a common shape parameter is assumed for all gamma distributions across all years (preliminary descriptive analysis suggested that this is the case).

Given the dimension of the dataset used here, we experienced some memory issues which could not be rectified. This was eventually dealt with by trying to find a compromise between tensor product basis dimension and dataset reduction. The final model was fitted on data obtained by averaging over a $150\times150$ grid for all years. The basis sizes (for the cubic regression splines and cyclic splines) and interior knots (for the soap film) are given in Table \ref{soap-basis-table}.

\end{tabular}

\label{soap-basis-table}
\end{table}

The spatiotemporal structure of model (\ref{PropM}) and the lack of availability of economic variables at municipal level would suggest to fit the model by also taking into account the possible presence of some unexplained spatial and autocorrelation structure in the data. In a smoothing spline context, this can be consistently achieved by using a mixed modelling approach (Breslow and Clayton 1993). This possibility was explored by using the \texttt{gamm()} function of the \texttt{mgcv} package, which iteratively calls the \texttt{lme()} function of the \texttt{nlme} package (Pinheiro et al. 2009) for maximization; no models could be fitted due to convergence failures (see, e.g., Ruppert, Wand, and Carroll (2003) and Wood (2006) for problems and limitations with this approach). To explore the sensitivity of our estimates, we tried a fixed effect approach (Wooldridge 2002) but there was no significant change in results.

\subsection{Variance estimation \label{VE}}

Taking a Bayesian view we can construct intervals using the posterior distribution of the model parameters. This approach was originally proposed by Wahba (1983) or Silverman (1985) in the univariate spline model context, and then generalized to the component-wise case when dealing with Gaussian and non-Gaussian data (e.g., Gu 2002; Gu and Wahba 1993; Ruppert, Wand, and Carroll 2003). The features of these intervals which are interesting here are that they include both a bias and a variance component (Nychka 1988), they have good observed \textit{frequentist} coverage probabilities across the function as shown, for example, in the simulation experiments of Wang and Wahba (1995). The posterior distribution is given as
\beq
\bm\theta|{\bf y} \dot{\backsim} N( \hat{\bm\theta}, {\bf V}_{\bm\theta} ),
\label{Poster}
\eeq
where $\hat{\bm\theta}$ is the maximum penalized likelihood estimate of $\bm\theta$ obtained as explained in the previous section, which is of the form $(\X\ts{\bf W}\X+{\bf S}^*)^{-1}\X\ts{\bf W}{\bf z}$. ${\bf V}_{\bm\theta} = (\X\ts{\bf W}\X+{\bf S}^*)^{-1}\phi$, $\X$ contains the columns associated with the regression spline bases used to set up the model, and ${\bf W}$ and $\mathbf{z}$ are the diagonal weight matrix and the pseudodata vector at convergence of the algorithm used to fit the penalized model (e.g., Wood 2006, 2010).

Given the result above, it is easy to find confidence intervals for linear functions of the parameters such as smooth components. Intervals for non-linear functions of the model coefficients can be efficiently obtained by simulation from the posterior distribution of $\bm\theta$. Result (\ref{Poster}) can also be used to produce trend estimates as discussed in the next section.

\subsection{Trend estimation \label{TE}}
To aid interpretation of the results and also possibly uncover interesting features in the data, trend estimates for some given areas of interest can be produced using the predictive distribution of $\texttt{irf}_{it}$, constructed employing the result of the previous section. This approach has been previously adopted in the literature (e.g., Augustin et al. 2009), and can be implemented as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Repeat the following steps for $b=1,\cdots,N_b$, where $N_b$ represents the number of random draws. 
	   \begin{enumerate}
	      \item Simulate a random $N(\hat{\bm\theta}, \hat{{\bf V}}_{\bm\theta} )$ and call the resulting coefficient vector $\bm\theta_b$.
	      \item Calculate $\widehat{\E(\texttt{irf}_{it})}=\widehat{\texttt{irf}}_{itb}=\exp(\X^*_{it}\bm\theta_b)$, where $\X^*_{it}$ is evaluated at the observed values. 
	      \item For a given area of interest $a$ and year $t$, calculate
	      $$\widehat{\overline{\texttt{irf}}}_{tb}^a=\frac{1}{n_a}\sum_{i=1}^{n_a} \widehat{\texttt{irf}}_{itb}.$$    
	   \end{enumerate}
	\item Produce the required summary statistics, in this case median, lower and upper $95\%$ quantiles, for the temporal trend $\widehat{\overline{\texttt{irf}}}_{tb}^a$.
\end{enumerate}
Small values for $N_b$ are typically tolerable. In practice, $N_b$ can be set to $100$. Increasing this value does not change the results which are presented in Section \ref{ER}.
